🦠 COVID-19 Daily Cases & Deaths – WHO Dataset (EDA Project)

This project is part of my internship at Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), where I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the daily reporting of new COVID-19 cases and deaths collected by WHO.

🔍 Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, anomalies, and formatting).

Analyze global and regional daily trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Compare the pandemic’s impact on high-income vs low-income countries.

Visualize the lag relationship between new cases and deaths.

Draw insights on how healthcare, testing, and vaccines influenced outcomes.

📊 Key Insights

The pandemic followed wave-like patterns, with multiple global surges.

Deaths lagged cases by 1–3 weeks, reflecting disease progression.

High-income countries: More reported cases due to stronger testing, but lower fatality rates.

Low-income countries: Under-reported cases, but higher proportional deaths.

Over time, case fatality ratios declined, influenced by vaccines and better healthcare.
